Every Friday during the year, the r/mcgill subreddit has a post entitled “REAL TALK FRIDAY” (previously “REAL TALK FRIDAYS”) in which members of the McGill University community can write comments about whatever they please, giving them an outlet to vent. This weekly tradition has been ongoing since January 2016. I took to analyzing the parent comments on these posts dating back to the first post, to get a better understanding of the frequency of words used as well as the polarity and subjectivity of the comments made. Above are all of the scripts used to collect, clean, and visualize the comments as well as the data and visualizations themselves.
