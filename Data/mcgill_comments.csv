IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'D BE LETTING THEM DOWN SOMEHOW IF YOUR LIFE WAS GOING TO SHIT, OR LIKE YOU'D BE ROBBING THEM OF THEIR INNOCENCE BY TELLING THEM THE TRUTH.

2020-11-06,"IN PERSON HEALTH SERVICES FOR 2021 WILL BE A SHIT SHOW RIGHT? LAST  YEAR THE CLINIC STOPPED OFFERING FLU SHOTS FOR STUDENTS DUE TO A QUEBEC HEALTH MANDATE. THIS YEAR THEY CANCELED STAFF SHOTS AS WELL, LEAVING THOUSANDS OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS (WHO ARE FORCED TO PAY 1K PLUS INSURANCE A YEAR) WHO HAVE NO FAMILY DOCTOR IN QUÉBEC TO THE MERCY OF THE OVERWHELMED PHARMACY DISTRIBUTION NETWORK. FOR THE REOPENING, I SEE NO INFORMATION ON THE ALREADY PITIFUL MEDICAL ATTENTION ACCESS FOR STUDENTS (LIMITED HOURS, LONG WAIT TIMES FOR APPOINTMENTS). IT'S SO ANGERING, MCGILL SHOULD HAVE BECOME A COVID TESTING HUB FOR ITS STUDENTS AND STAFF EVEN IF THERE WERE NO ACTIVITIES ON CAMPUS. INSTEAD THEY'RE ACTING LIKE THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR KEEPING STUDENTS SAFE. THE WINTER IN-PERSON DEMANDS FOR PROFS, TA'S AND STUDENTS TO SHOW UP ONLY EXACERBATE THIS, IT'S NEGLIGENT AND SO DISAPPOINTING.   CURIOUS HOW/WHETHER STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SCHEDULE THEIR FLU SHOTS TOO."

I KNOW THE SOLUTION IS TO REDUCE MY SCREEN TIME FOR A WHILE BUT LITERALLY EVERY COMPONENT OF EVERY COURSE INVOLVES A SCREEN NOW SO IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN MY VISION AND MY GPA.
2020-09-11,"EVERY TIME I JOIN A LECTURE MEETING I END UP GETTING BORED, AND WHEN I’M BORED I GET SNACKY. AMD WHEN I’M SNACKY, THERES NO HOLDING ME BACK.   I GET SO EASILY DISTRACTED IT’S ACTUALLY CRAZY. I BE LISTENING TO THE LECTURE THEN PAINT MY NAILS OR PLAY ANIMAL CROSSING FOR HOURS ON END."

I GET THAT THEY NEED TIME TO LIKE, CURVE IT AND REVIEW THE FOOTAGE TO SEE IF ANYONE CHEATED BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO SCORE ANYTHING (IT WAS ALL CLICKING THE ANSWER ON THEIR SITE) AND THE GRE PEOPLE GET AN APPROXIMATE SCORE RIGHT AFTER THEY FINISH.  ALSO, SENDING EMAILS TO PROFESSORS TO GROVEL FOR REFERENCES IS THE WOOOOORST. ""HEY YOU MAY REMEMBER ME FROM SUCH TIMES AS WHEN I EMAILED YOU TO TELL YOU I COULDN'T COME TO CLASS BECAUSE I HAD TO GET A BLOODTEST TO SEE IF I STILL HAD LYME DISEASE AFTER TAKING ANTIBIOTICS (I DIDN'T WOOOOOO) AND ALL THOSE TIMES I SAT IN THE BACK OF YOUR CLASSROOM, SILENTLY, INTIMIDATED BECAUSE THIS ISN'T MY MAJOR OR MINOR."

WITH THE REMOTE FALL SEMESTER, THIS COVID SITUATION HAS OFFICIALLY DELAYED MY GRADUATION BY AT LAST 9 MONTHS. MY SCHOLARSHIP WILL BE RUNNING OUT BEFORE I CAN GRADUATE. FML."

2020-05-15,I REGRET TAKING A MIDTERM IN ONE OF MY CLASSES AS THE PROF DECIDED TO LET PEOPLE DELAY TAKING IT IF THEY WANTED AND IT JUST SO HAPPENED TO BE RIGHT BEFORE MCGILL WENT ONLINE AND HE GHOSTED THE CLASS.

THOSE WHO DIDNT JUST GOT NO GRADE AND THE BURDEN SHIFTED TO THE FINAL...PRETTY SURE IM GONNA HAVE TO RETAKE IT EVEN WITH THE S/U BC OF THAT. FML SO MUCH FOR GRADUATING ON TIME

SOMETIMES THAT SCRATCHY STRAINED WHISPERING PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY JUST WANT TO SPEAK (YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN) IS EVEN MORE DISRUPTIVE THAN JUST OPENLY TALKING. I TRY TO BE UNDERSTANDING AND I KNOW IM ASKING A LOT BUT THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF TALKING FRIENDLY BUT STILL QUIETISH STUDY AREAS AVAILABLE AND THIS IS! NOT! ONE! OF! THEM! IF YOU HAVE A PERSISTENT HARSH COUGH YOU SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED ON THE SILENT FLOOR OF THE LIBRARY AND I AM NOT AFRAID TO SAY IT!!!! I UNDERSTAND THE OCCASIONAL WHISPER OR COUGH OR SNIFFLE BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE CONSISTENTLY CREATING A LEVEL OF NOISE THAT IS LOUDER THAN SILENCE THEN YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO BUSINESS STUDYING ON THE SILENT FLOOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM SORRY THIS IS HARSH BUT IVE BEEN HOLDING IT IN FOR SO LONG AND AS SOMEONE WHO HAS IMMENSE DIFFICULTY STUDYING WITHOUT COMPLETE SILENCE (AND SENSORY ISSUES THAT MAKE ME ABSOLUTELY HATE EAR PLUGS) THIS FRUSTRATES ME TO NO END ON A POSITIVE NOTE I GRADUATE THIS SEMESTER SO PEACE OUT TO THIS PROBLEM IN CIRCA 3 MONTHS

AND THEN MY URGE EXTENDS TO SEEING HANDSOME MEN WITH GOOD GENES AT MCGILL AND THINKING OF OUR POTENTIAL BABIES. I WANNA JUST HAVE SOFT BABIES WITH ME THAT CAN CUDDLE WITH ME AND HUG ME.  AND THEN MY FRIEND URGED ME TO GO TO THE ENGINEERING BUILDING CAUSE SHE WANTED TO SEE HANDSOME MEN THERE BUT THEN ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS THE CUTE LITTLE BABIES I COULD MAKE WITH THOSE MEN. AHHH I SWEAR MY HORMONES NEED TO CALM DOWN. I HAVE ALREADY MADE A FACTORY OF BABIES WITH MY EYES WITH THOSE MEN.  THANK YOU. I SAID IT. MAN THAT FELT GOOD. NOW I SHALL GO HIDE IN MY DEN FROM THE EMBARRASSMENT AND SLEEP.

2018-09-21,"I LOVE RAINY AUTUMN MORNING FEELINGS. IT IS COOL AND WINDY AND LOVELY. BLUSTERY EVEN.  THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON R/MCGILL WHO SEEM VERY SAD. SOME UNSOLICITED NONPROFESSIONAL ADVICE: LET YOURSELF BE SAD SOMETIMES. IT IS EXHAUSTING TO TRY AND BE OKAY ALL THE TIME. CONSTANTLY FIGHTING AGAINST IT WON'T ACTUALLY HELP IT WILL JUST LEAVE YOU WONDERING THINGS LIKE ""WHY CAN'T I BE NORMAL AND HAPPY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE"".  OTHER PEOPLE GET SAD TOO. YOU MAY JUST BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION PROBLEMS YOU NEED TO LEARN TO COPE WITH, BUT ACCEPTING YOURSELF CAN BE HELPFUL. CHANNELING THAT SADNESS CAN ALSO BE HELPFUL - ART, MUSIC, SCREAMING INTO THE VOID.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO FOR A WALK IN THE RAIN.   HAVE A GOOD WEEKEND EVERYONE."

AT LEAST I CAN LOOK FORWARD TO (HAVING MORE TIME TRYING TO GET INTO) A DECENT SLEEP SCHEDULE AND A BETTER FRAME OF MIND."

2017-12-15,THE THING IS THAT EVERYTHING SUCKS AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY FRIENDS BUT THE LIGHT IS REFLECTING REALLY BEAUTIFULLY OFF THE MOUNTAIN AND DESPITE EVERYTHING I'M GLAD TO BE ALIVE AND HERE RIGHT NOW TO SEE IT.  I'VE RUN OUT OF FUCKS TO GIVE ABOUT STUDYING MORE. I COULD GO OVER ALL MY NOTES AGAIN I GUESS BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH ELSE I COULD DO. MAYBE WRITE EXAMPLE IDENTIFY AND STATE SIGNIFICANCE FOR HIST 226. COOL OFF TO DO THAT
2017-12-15,I CAME TO THE REVELATION RECENTLY THAT I HAVE BEEN REALLY DEPRESSED FOR THE PAST FEW MONTHS AFTER STARTING HERE AND I REALLY SUPPRESSED THAT FEELING WITH MY WORK. I WAS WALKING AROUND LISTENING TO JOY DIVISION AND SMOKING (EDGY I KNOW) WHEN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN PREPARING FOR FINALS AND I JUST TOTALLY DISASSOCIATED FOR A MINUTE AND IT WAS KIND OF SCARY BUT THEN I FEEL LIKE I SNAPPED OUT OF SOME KIND DREAM I HAD BEEN IN FOR MONTHS. I FEEL... STRANGE? IDK I AM JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO TAKING A BREAK AND RECUPERATING B/C I'M DONE WITH FINALS.  I ALSO HAD NO FRIENDS AND THEN I MET THIS GIRL AND WE HAVE ALL THE SAME INTERESTS AND WE SHARE DERRIDA MEMES WITH EACH OTHER AND SHE ACTUALLY THINKS IT'S COOL THAT I'M A HUMANITIES MAJOR SO I FEEL KIND OF GOOD I GUESS. IT FEELS NICE TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT WITH SOMEONE FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE.

2017-12-15,"I JUST FINISHED HOLDING MY FIRST REVIEW SESSION AND HOLY FUCK I WAS SO SCARED AND I WORKED MY ASS OFF. MY FRIEND SAID THAT IT WAS GOOD BUT IDK IF I TRUST HIM ENTIRELY. NO ONE ELSE WANTED TO RUN THE REVIEW SESSION SO EVEN THOUGH IM TERRIBLE AT PUBLIC SPEAKING, I GAVE IT A SHOT. I SPENT A TON OF TIME JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW I WANTED THE REVIEW SESSION TO GO. SOME OF IT DIDNT GO TO PLAN (LIKE FUCK ME I CANT STUDY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S EXAM INSTEAD KF STUDYING FOR MY OWN) BUT AT LEAST I COVERED THE MATERIAL WELL AND I DIDNT MAKE TERRIBLE, NERVOUS JOKES. IM SO DEHYDRATED."

AFTER TWO WEEKS OF SEVERE AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE FLARING AND SEEMINGLY ENDLESS EXHAUSTION I CAVED AND REQUESTED A DEFERRAL OF ONE OF MY FINALS. I DIDN'T GO GET A DOCTORS NOTE EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I SHOULD BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER DEFERRED A FINAL BEFORE AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO SPEND HOURS GOING TO ONE OF MY SPECIALISTS JUST FOR A NOTE. BESIDES, I COULD HARDLY WALK UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON - SEEMS A BIT BETTER NOW.  NOW I AM DESPERATELY TRYING TO STUDY FOR THE LAST ONE, BUT TODAY THERE WERE ISSUES WITH THE ELECTRICITY, MY LAPTOP HAD NO CHARGE, THE HEAT SHUT OFF FOR FIVE HOURS AND I COULDN'T EVEN LEAVE BECAUSE I HAD TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO COME FIX IT. I WAS SO COLD, AND SO FRUSTRATED.  LUCKILY, AN ELECTRICIAN CAME AND NOW I HAVE HEAT AGAIN AND I CARE 90% LESS ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.  STILL, UGH, THIS FIRST SEMESTER HAS BEEN MUCH HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE COURSE WORK - JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO FIGHT MY STUPID BODY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.   OKAY. THAT'S ALL."
2017-12-15,105 COMMENTS WITHIN 24 HOURS!  I HAVE TO CONFESS THAT I USUALLY MASS UPVOTE EVERYTHING IN REAL TALK.  I SAW THE THERAPY DOGS IN BROWN BLDG YESTERDAY - JASPER IS A GEM.

2017-12-15,THIS SEMESTER HAS BEEN A M E S S BUT IT’S ALMOST OVER SO I GUESS THAT’S GOOD
2017-12-15,MENTAL HEALTH JOKES AREN'T FUNNY. CASUALLY DROPPING THAT 'I WANNA KILL MYSELF' IS REALLY FUCKED UP.

AND IF I STAY HERE AND STUDY AND THEN SHE DIES, I'LL HAVE FAILED HER AS WELL.   EXAMS FEEL SO INCONSEQUENTIAL WHEN MY NANA COULD DIE LITERALLY ANY DAY."
2017-04-14,"I USED TO MASTURBATE ONTO BIRDS AT A LOCAL PARK. NOT A THING THAT I'M PARTICULARLY PROUD OF BUT I BECAME QUITE GOOD AT IT. I WAS TAKING ZINC SUPPLEMENTS SO I WAS SHOOTING MASSIVE LOADS AND IT BECAME SOMETHING OF A SPORT TO ME. FOR ANYONE INTERESTED HERE IS YOUR BEST STRATEGY. FIRST, YOU NEED TO FIND AN ISOLATED SPOT SO YOU DON'T BECOME A SEX OFFENDER. I FOUND A SHORT KIND OF CHANNEL AREA WHERE I SAW THE PIGEONS WOULD CONGREGATE. NEXT, YOU AROUSE YOURSELF. I WAS USUALLY CONTENT WITH ENVISIONING THE OCCASIONAL JOGGING LADY COMING OVER AND TAKING A SHIT ON MY CHEST AND THAT WAS ENOUGH TO FUEL THE FIRE BUT IF YOU'RE NOT AS SEXUALLY CHARGED AS ME JUST TAKE SOME PORN ON THE GO. AFTER YOU'RE GOOD AN HORNY, YOU GET SOME BREAD. MY PIGEONS PREFERRED WHITE BREAD BUT HEALTHIER BIRDS MIGHT HAVE A TASTE FOR HONEY WHEAT OR MAYBE EVEN MULTIGRAIN. FAT, UNHEALTHY BIRDS ARE SLOWER AND EASIER TO HIT SO REMEMBER THAT. ONCE YOU ARE SEATED ON THE BENCH AND READY TO DO THE DEED, WHIP YOUR ROOSEVELT OUT AND SCATTER BREAD OUT WITHIN A FEW FEET OF YOU. USE YOUR JUDGEMENT BASED ON HOW FAR YOU KNOW YOU CAN CUM. I WAS A LONELY AND DEPRAVED SOUL WHO COULD HIT TARGETS THE SIZE OF A THIMBLE AT DISTANCES UP TO 4 FEET. YOU WAIT FOR THE PIGEONS TO BEGIN EATING AND TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH YOUR PRESENCE. AT THIS POINT, YOU WANT TO COO GENTLY AND TALK SENSUALLY TO THEM TO GAIN THEIR TRUST. NOW YOU'RE FINALLY READY TO CUM ON YOUR BIRD. THIS IS A TOUGH PART BECAUSE THE RAPID MOTION OF MASTURBATION IS VERY FRIGHTENING TO THE BIRDS, SO YOU HAVE TO BE SUBTLE. ONCE YOU MASTER A TECHNIQUE, YOU SIMPLY WIND IT UP AND LET IT GO, AIMING DEPENDING ON YOUR PAST CUMMING EXPERIENCES. I ALWAYS CAME HIGH SO I WOULD AIM FOR THE NECK OF THE BIRD AND CATCH IT RIGHT IN THE FACE. IT'S AN EXTREMELY SATISFYING AND EROTIC FEELING, SEEING THOSE BIRDS REEL AROUND COVERED IN CUM AND MAYBE EVEN TRANSPORTING IT TO OTHER PLACES IN THE CITY. EITHER WAY I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN YEARS BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN I CATCH MYSELF GAZING WISTFULLY AT A FLOCK OF BIRDS, COCK THROBBING AND WAITING FOR THEM TO LAND CLOSE TO ME."
2017-04-14,I WISH THIS LONG WEEKEND WASN'T DURING FINALS.

But seriously, these guys acts like protesting nuts from Community. As an engineering student, I don't really care what you do. All those random stickers you stick it on the bathroom hand driers doesn't really bother me. (Sure it's annoying, but whatever) But what I heard you guys did on the 29th to the CAE booth is just ridiculous.   Please, tell me any university in top 50 that has zero connection with the military. Also, do you even know how many engineering companies out there has ties with the military? Are you planning on protesting and throwing fake blood onto all of those companies that visits McGill?   Be reasonable. I don't care if you silently protest or write some blog/movement somewhere on the internet. But just don't interfere with other people's lives. There were people at that CAE booth trying to learn about the company and trying to apply/get a job at that company. How about you ""demilitarize mcgill"" people try to recruit engineering companies with zero ties with the military to come to McGill and promote them?   For real though, this group makes me ashamed to be a McGill student and I hope none of these companies are deterred from coming to McGill to promote their companies just because of shenanigans like this."
