2020-12-04,the worst part about visiting your parents is that you know how badly they want you to be happy and not to struggle in life  and you know that if they knew what your actual mental state was like they'd feel terrible and guilty and they'd try to help you even though there's nothing they can do  so you suppress everything and put a smile on your face and pretend everything's great  and you cherry pick the best  happiest aspects of your life to tell them about  it almost feels like you'd be letting them down somehow if your life was going to shit  or like you'd be robbing them of their innocence by telling them the truth  it's heartbreaking when you watch them react happily when you tell them everything's going really well knowing that you're lying to them to protect them and that it's not true ,2020,12

2020-11-06,in person health services for 2021 will be a shit show right  last  year the clinic stopped offering flu shots for students due to a quebec health mandate  this year they canceled staff shots as well  leaving thousands of international students  who are forced to pay 1k plus insurance a year  who have no family doctor in québec to the mercy of the overwhelmed pharmacy distribution network  for the reopening  i see no information on the already pitiful medical attention access for students  limited hours  long wait times for appointments   it's so angering  mcgill should have become a covid testing hub for its students and staff even if there were no activities on campus  instead they're acting like they are not responsible for keeping students safe  the winter in person demands for profs  ta's and students to show up only exacerbate this  it's negligent and so disappointing    curious how whether students have been able to schedule their flu shots too ,2020,11

2020-11-06,on god comp 303 is going to be the fucking death of me  extra mad about it bc i actually like the course content and like that the lectures are bite sized but constantly having an assignment due that has to be coordinated with others is giving me visible hair loss   like this last assignment i got my implementation done fast so i could have the weekend to do other shit and then do my review portion on monday  but then the other person assigned to review the same problem i was wrote a fucking novel an hour after that implementation was posted so then i had no choice but to jump in and do my review before they could say literally everything that could possibly be said  and its like damn its not even their fault  theyre just tryna get their marks  but it just sucks ass being at mercy of everyone else    it sucks for the people who arent as comfortable with programming bc their code just gets bulldozed over and they cant actually learn the shit but it also sucks for the tryhards too bc if the project is shit they end up needing to rewrite it or fix broken ass tests or botched merges or whatever the fuck else and its just exhausting  also if people could stop including their ide settings in git that would be appreciated,2020,11

2019-11-01,i don't vent this to my close friends or my mom too much but here i go with this embarrassing confession   since a year i've had this sudden urge to have cute babies  i am not in a relationship and currently very career focused but whenever i see a cute baby outside i just want it and cuddle with it and wanna just drop out of uni and have a bunch of little softies with me at home and become a mother   and then my urge extends to seeing handsome men with good genes at mcgill and thinking of our potential babies  i wanna just have soft babies with me that can cuddle with me and hug me   and then my friend urged me to go to the engineering building cause she wanted to see handsome men there but then all i could think about was the cute little babies i could make with those men  ahhh i swear my hormones need to calm down  i have already made a factory of babies with my eyes with those men   thank you  i said it  man that felt good  now i shall go hide in my den from the embarrassment and sleep ,2019,11

2018-08-17,ive almost become friends with the other interns here and im going to miss them all so much  i wonder if its actually possible for me to have real friends at mcgill  maybe it would be possible if my extracurricular activities didnt consist mainly of helping other people instead of going out and having fun  helping others is really important to me but i feel like im starting to base my identity and self worth on whether or not i can solve other people s problems  idk is this insightful or am i just talking out of my ass ,2018,8

2017-04-14,i used to masturbate onto birds at a local park  not a thing that i'm particularly proud of but i became quite good at it  i was taking zinc supplements so i was shooting massive loads and it became something of a sport to me  for anyone interested here is your best strategy  first  you need to find an isolated spot so you don't become a sex offender  i found a short kind of channel area where i saw the pigeons would congregate  next  you arouse yourself  i was usually content with envisioning the occasional jogging lady coming over and taking a shit on my chest and that was enough to fuel the fire but if you're not as sexually charged as me just take some porn on the go  after you're good an horny  you get some bread  my pigeons preferred white bread but healthier birds might have a taste for honey wheat or maybe even multigrain  fat  unhealthy birds are slower and easier to hit so remember that  once you are seated on the bench and ready to do the deed  whip your roosevelt out and scatter bread out within a few feet of you  use your judgement based on how far you know you can cum  i was a lonely and depraved soul who could hit targets the size of a thimble at distances up to 4 feet  you wait for the pigeons to begin eating and to get comfortable with your presence  at this point  you want to coo gently and talk sensually to them to gain their trust  now you're finally ready to cum on your bird  this is a tough part because the rapid motion of masturbation is very frightening to the birds  so you have to be subtle  once you master a technique  you simply wind it up and let it go  aiming depending on your past cumming experiences  i always came high so i would aim for the neck of the bird and catch it right in the face  it's an extremely satisfying and erotic feeling  seeing those birds reel around covered in cum and maybe even transporting it to other places in the city  either way i haven't done it in years but every now and then i catch myself gazing wistfully at a flock of birds  cock throbbing and waiting for them to land close to me ,2017,4
2017-04-14,i wish this long weekend wasn't during finals ,2017,4
